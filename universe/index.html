          <p>
            We are building the first <i>human</i> programming language: a creative tool for people, not programmers. This language is open-ended like LEGO. Building blocks, not templates. And it's designed for mobile devices: the computers we all have.<br>
            It starts with a new kind of canvas. We call them cards. Not apps or websites, but cards. And  anyone can make them—no coding required. Cards run natively on your phone, but they can link to  each other and be embedded anywhere.<br>
            The cards you make aren't floating in space. They exist in a network called <b>Universe</b>.<br>
          <b>Universe</b> isn't a single product or destination. It's a set of tools and a community designed to evolve what the world can do with the web.</p>

          Complex things should be possible.”</i><br><b>&ndash;Alan Kay</b></p></div><p>
          <div class="heading2">Who</div>
          <p>
            We are a group of designers & programmers, musicians & mathematicians, artists & philosophers.
            We come from companies like Google, Khan Academy, and Kickstarter. We have built startups before.<br>
            We're students of thinkers old and new—Alan Kay, Seymour Papert, Doug Engelbart, Ted Nelson, Bill Atkinson, Stewart Brand, Bret Victor — and their creations—Hypercard, Smalltalk, Mindstorms, the Web. <br>
            Computers at their best decentralize power — they liberate the individual and facilitate collective intelligence. The devices have become mainstream but this profound freedom has not. We want to change that.<br>
            This is a dream project for each of us: a way to apply our learnings—and dreams—towards a better future for computing. <br>
            We're 7 people based in Brooklyn, NY. We've raised capital from premier investors, so we have the resources we need to make this dream real. Now we need you.
          </p>

So far, remotely done power and glory—as via government, big business, formal education, church—has succeeded to the point where gross defects obscure actual gains. In response to this dilemma and to these gains a realm of intimate, personal power is developing—power of the individual to conduct his own education, find his own inspiration, shape his own environment, and share his adventure with whoever is interested."</i><br><b>&ndash;Stewart Brand</b></p></div><p>

            <h2>Engineers & Designers</h2><br>
            We're looking for gifted engineers and designers who know the ins-and-outs of iOS,  who can imagine new interactions, invent new user interfaces. <br>
            <h2>Community of Creators</h2><br>
            We're building a community of creators who share our vision and are eager to explore and create in this new mobile, digital world. <br>
            Reach out to <a href="mailto:curious@un1verse.co">curious@un1verse.co</a> with interest. Why does this project resonate? What have you made as an expression of <i>your</i> values?

          <div class="heading2">How</div>
          <p>
            This is our work-in-progress, constantly evolving, collective constitution. The principles that inform the product and how we work.

              <b>Collaboration.</b><br>

            </li>
            <li><img src="images/bullet.gif" width="10">
              <b>Beauty.</b><br>

              <b>Determination.</b><br>
              <span class="value">To accomplish what people think is impossible, we must try harder. Find a solution when none seems to exist.</span>

              <b>Focus.</b><br>

          <div class="quote"><p><i>
            “Education is a social process; education is growth; education is not preparation for life but is life itself.”</i>
          <br><b>&ndash;John Dewey</b></p></div>
          <div class="heading2">Why</div>
          <p>
            Pocket-sized supercomputers have powered a paradigm shift in how we learn, connect, and communicate.
            But what can we actually <i>make</i> with phones? The answer is not much.<br>
            The tools we <i>do</i> have to express ourselves and explore online feel shrunken, primitive: imposing limits instead of ripping open opportunity and unleashing new forms of creativity. 140 characters, 6 seconds, 150 friends.<br>
            The digital world shapes life as we know it. But as the devices we use every day have advanced in complexity and scope, the power to shape that world is limited to a few, and the world is worse off for it.<br>
            We think that if everyone had the power to build things with technology—even if they don’t  program—the world would be an infinitely better, richer, and more interesting place.
